          <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Brothers Rising is a men's wellbeing movement rooted in community, compassion, and conscious personal growth. We exist to support men in navigating the inner and outer challenges of modern life — from emotional isolation and burnout to purpose, identity, and belonging.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We believe that when men are given the space to slow down, speak openly, and be witnessed without judgement, deep healing and meaningful transformation become possible.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-white leading-relaxed">
            Our work is grounded, inclusive, and heart‑led — honouring both the strength and the softness required to live a full, healthy life as a man.

          <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Disconnection, suppressed emotion, stress, and a lack of meaningful support are taking a toll on men's mental, emotional, and physical health. Brothers Rising was created in response to this reality — to offer an alternative.
