# **Brothers Rising Conscious Men's Retreat**

## **A Full Weekend Immersion | 13–15 March | Waterfall Farm**

### **Step Out of the Noise. Return to Yourself. Rise with Your Brothers.**

The Brothers Rising Conscious Men's Retreat is a **2-night, 2-day immersive experience** designed for men who are ready to slow down, reconnect, and do meaningful inner work in a grounded, supportive environment.

Set in the natural beauty of **Waterfall Farm**, this retreat invites you to step away from daily pressures and responsibilities and into a container of presence, brotherhood, and transformation.

This is not a getaway. It is a **return** — to yourself, to nature, and to the deeper truths that live beneath the surface.

## **Why This Retreat**

Modern life rarely gives men the space to pause, feel, and reflect.

This retreat exists to create that space — intentionally, safely, and with depth.

Over the course of a full weekend, you will be guided through a series of workshops, practices, and shared experiences that support:
• Emotional awareness and expression
• Nervous system regulation and embodied presence
• Healing old patterns and stories
• Strengthening self-trust, clarity, and inner leadership
• Deep connection with other men walking a similar path

You do not need to arrive with all the answers — only an open heart and willingness to show up honestly.

## **What We'll Be Exploring**

The retreat journey weaves together inner work, embodiment, and nature-based practices. Each experience is facilitated with care, respect, and long-term integration in mind.

### **Core Themes and Pillars**

#### **1: Connection to Self**

**Breathwork & Meditation**
Guided breath and meditation practices to support nervous system regulation, emotional release, and deeper self-awareness.

**Alignment & Values**
Practices that refine clarity and presence, helping you explore what truly matters and define your values based on your truth.

#### **2: Deep Work**

**Shadow Work**
Exploring the hidden or disowned parts of ourselves with compassion, bringing unconscious patterns into conscious awareness and empowerment.

**Inner Warrior Work**
Reconnecting with the Warrior Archetype — healthy masculine strength, boundaries, courage, and self-leadership. This process allows participants to step into their full embodied conscious warrior self.

**Inner Child Work**
Guided flows and prompts that create space to reconnect with your younger self with curiosity, care, and healing attention. Playful but held experiences to help you connect with your inner child and allow space for old wounds to be felt and nurtured.

#### **3: Nature**

**Reconnection to Nature**
Grounding experiences that restore our relationship with the natural world as a source of wisdom, reflection, and support.

## **The Experience**

Throughout the weekend, we will also engage in:
• **Guided hikes** through the surrounding landscape
• **Fire ceremonies** for reflection, release, and intention setting
• **Rewilding practices** that invite the body and senses back into ancestral instinct, rhythm, and presence
• **Men's circles** rooted in confidentiality, respect, and brotherhood
• **Meditation and silent time** for deep reflection and integration
• **Journal prompts and reflections** to help you process your experiences and guide your next steps

There will be space for both depth and rest — moments of challenge balanced with integration, silence, and reflection.

## **Who This Retreat Is For**

This retreat is for men who:
• Value deep connection and authentic brotherhood
• Are committed to personal growth and self-development
• Feel called to emotional and inner healing work
• Are open to reflection, embodiment, and conscious exploration

## **The Location – Waterfall Farm**

Nestled in nature, **Waterfall Farm** offers a powerful setting for retreat work — combining comfort, simplicity, and connection to the land.

Accommodation will be in **shared glamping-style bell tents** — beautifully appointed spaces that allow for both rest and a sense of communal living that supports the retreat container.

Each tent sleeps 2 people, creating the opportunity to build stronger bonds with your brothers.

The land itself is part of the experience, inviting stillness, reflection, and grounding throughout the weekend.
